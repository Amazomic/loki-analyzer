# Since this is a simple ESM-based app, we don't necessarily have a complex build step 
# unless using a bundler. Assuming a standard static host setup.
# If you use vite or similar, add: RUN npm install && npm run build

# Final stage - using Nginx to serve static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy files to nginx public directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Expose port 80
